This folder contains all the draft versions of the codes for CBOW and Skip-gram.

CBOW1.py
Basic version of CBOW. Input vector is a B-by-2*N*V vector, where B = batch size (= number of samples in the dataset in this case). Input text is a paragraph from "Conquering 
the GRE" by Yoni Kahn. No fancy text parsing library or dataset managing library.
